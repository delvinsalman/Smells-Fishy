# Smells Fishy üêü

**Smells-Fishy** is a data visualization project built with JavaScript using **p5.js**, exploring seafood consumption per capita across all countries. The project utilizes an interactive **boid flocking system**, dynamic animations, and a **legend-based color system** to present global consumption trends in an engaging way.

## Features

- **Boid Flocking System** ‚Äì Simulates the movement of fish based on seafood consumption data.
- **Legend System** ‚Äì Helps users understand the color-coordinated representation of consumption levels.
- **Animated Slider** ‚Äì Allows users to navigate through different years of data.
- **Hover Interaction** ‚Äì Displays country-specific consumption details dynamically.
- **Responsive Visualization** ‚Äì Adjusts movement speed, background brightness, and visual vibrancy based on per capita seafood consumption.

## Visualization Concept

The visualization dynamically adapts to data values:
- **Lower seafood consumption** ‚Üí Slower movement, dim background, and subdued colors.
- **Higher seafood consumption** ‚Üí Faster movement, vibrant colors, and a more dynamic environment.

This design reflects the relationship between consumption levels and the corresponding **ecosystem impact**.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (p5.js)** ‚Äì For rendering visuals and animations.
- **HTML & CSS** ‚Äì For layout and styling.
- **Data Processing** ‚Äì Uses JavaScript to handle global seafood consumption data.

## How to Use
1. Open the project in a web browser.
2. Interact with the visualization by hovering over different elements.
3. Use the animated slider to explore seafood consumption data over different years.
4. Observe how the environment reacts to different consumption levels.

## Future Enhancements
- **Additional Data Insights** ‚Äì Display deeper analysis with more interactive elements.
- **Expanded Interactivity** ‚Äì More ways for users to engage with the visualization.
- **Performance Optimizations** ‚Äì Improve efficiency for smoother animations.
